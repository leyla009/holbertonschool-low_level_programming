# Structures and Typedef

## Description
This project focuses on understanding and using **structures** and the **typedef** keyword in C.  
It covers how to define, initialize, and manipulate structures, as well as how to simplify structure usage with `typedef`.

These concepts are essential for organizing related data and writing clearer, more maintainable C programs.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What a structure is and when to use it
- How to define and use structures in C
- How to access structure members
- How to pass structures to functions
- What `typedef` is and how to use it
- The difference between a structure and a `typedef`-defined type

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**
- Programs compiled using:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

- All files should end with a new line
- Code must follow **Betty** style
- No global variables allowed
- Only standard library functions allowed (`malloc`, `free`, `printf`, etc.)
