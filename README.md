📌 Overview

This repository contains projects and exercises completed as part of the Holberton School Low-Level Programming curriculum. It focuses on building a strong foundation in C programming, understanding how software interacts with hardware, and mastering core computer science concepts such as memory management, pointers, recursion, data structures, and system-level programming.

The goal of this repository is not only to write working programs, but to write clean, efficient, and well-documented C code that follows Holberton's strict coding standards.

🧠 Topics Covered

Throughout this repository, you will find projects covering:

C programming basics

Compilation process (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking)

Variables, control structures, and functions

Pointers, arrays, and strings

Recursion

Static and dynamic libraries

Memory allocation (malloc, free)

Structures and typedef

Function pointers

Variadic functions

Singly and doubly linked lists

Bit manipulation

File I/O

Algorithms and complexity

📂 Repository Structure

Each directory corresponds to a specific project or topic:

holbertonschool-low_level_programming/
│
├── hello_world/
├── variables_if_else_while/
├── functions_nested_loops/
├── pointers_arrays_strings/
├── recursion/
├── malloc_free/
├── structures_typedef/
├── linked_lists/
├── bit_manipulation/
├── file_io/
└── ...

Each project directory contains:

Source files (.c)

Header files (.h)

A project-specific README.md (when required)

🛠️ Requirements

Unless stated otherwise, all projects follow these requirements:

Language: C

Compiler: gcc

Compilation flags:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

Code style: Betty

No global variables (unless explicitly allowed)

No standard library functions unless permitted

All files end with a new line

▶️ Compilation & Usage

Example compilation:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o program_name

Run the program:

./program_name
✍️ Coding Style

All code follows the Betty style guide, which enforces:

Clear and consistent formatting

Proper indentation

Descriptive function and variable names

Complete function documentation

To check style:

betty *.c *.h
🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing the projects in this repository, I am developing the ability to:

Write efficient and readable C programs

Understand low-level memory operations

Use recursion and pointers effectively

Build and manipulate data structures

Debug segmentation faults and memory leaks

Read and understand system-level C code
